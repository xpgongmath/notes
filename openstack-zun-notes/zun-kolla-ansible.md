# Install Zun with Kolla-Ansible

## Wrong etcd cluster host

Check [this](https://docs.openstack.org/kolla-ansible/latest/reference/zun-guide.html#preparation-and-deployment) <DOCKER\_SERVICE\_IP> is zun-compute host IP. Actually, it should be vip address (controller nodes).

## Lack configurable options

* Database type?
* ...

## What should I do?

* Commit! Of course!
